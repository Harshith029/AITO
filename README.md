# üö¶ AITO: AI-Powered Intelligent Traffic Optimization System

> **Note:** This project is **under active development**. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

---

## üìå Overview

**AITO** (AI-powered Intelligent Traffic Optimization) is a full-stack, modular traffic control and optimization platform. It dynamically manages vehicle routing in real time using AI/ML and rich public infrastructure data ‚Äî including **weather**, **school timings**, **road width**, **vehicle size**, **event schedules**, **Google Maps traffic data**, and more ‚Äî to optimize mobility in cities.

The system predicts congestion before it happens and proactively reroutes traffic. Whether it's **public transport (e.g. TSRTC buses)** or **general road traffic**, AITO helps intelligently split traffic using **all viable roads** based on AI's understanding of the city.

## üß† Core Features

* ‚úÖ AI-powered route decision-making (SmartRoute Engine)
* ‚úÖ Predicts congestion and reroutes *before* it happens
* ‚úÖ Considers **vehicle size**, **road width**, **crowd flow**, **time**, **events**, **weather**
* ‚úÖ Real-time and historical data analysis
* ‚úÖ React + FastAPI full-stack architecture
* ‚úÖ Multi-user form interface and smart API
* ‚úÖ Smart rerouting within allowed road constraints
* ‚úÖ Future integration with Google Maps API for real-time traffic overlays
* ‚úÖ TSRTC-aware suggestions based on fixed routes

---

## üåü Project Goals

1. **Optimize TSRTC & public transport**: Smartly balance passengers using fixed routes
2. **Prevent congestion** using predictive modeling and AI routing
3. **Minimize fuel use**, delays, and emissions across traffic segments
4. **Use all valid paths** (including service roads or alternate legal routes)
5. **Personalize suggestions** using context-aware AI (user type, time, traffic, etc.)
6. **Build real-time, dynamic, map-enhanced interfaces** for all users (public and admin)

---

## üöÄ Use Cases
