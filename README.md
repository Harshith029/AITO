ðŸ“Œ Overview

AITO (AI-powered Intelligent Traffic Optimization) is a full-stack, modular traffic control and optimization platform. It dynamically manages vehicle routing in real time using AI/ML and rich public infrastructure data â€” including weather, school timings, road width, vehicle size, event schedules, Google Maps traffic data, and more â€” to optimize mobility in cities.

The system predicts congestion before it happens and proactively reroutes traffic. Whether it's public transport (e.g. TSRTC buses) or general road traffic, AITO helps intelligently split traffic using all viable roads based on AI's understanding of the city.

ðŸ§  Core Features

âœ… AI-powered route decision-making (SmartRoute Engine)

âœ… Predicts congestion and reroutes before it happens

âœ… Considers vehicle size, road width, crowd flow, time, events, weather

âœ… Real-time and historical data analysis

âœ… React + FastAPI full-stack architecture

âœ… Multi-user form interface and smart API

âœ… Smart rerouting within allowed road constraints

âœ… Future integration with Google Maps API for real-time traffic overlays

âœ… TSRTC-aware suggestions based on fixed routes

ðŸŒŸ Project Goals

Optimize TSRTC & public transport: Smartly balance passengers using fixed routes

Prevent congestion using predictive modeling and AI routing

Minimize fuel use, delays, and emissions across traffic segments

Use all valid paths (including service roads or alternate legal routes)

Personalize suggestions using context-aware AI (user type, time, traffic, etc.)

Build real-time, dynamic, map-enhanced interfaces for all users (public and admin)
