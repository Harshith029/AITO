# 🚦 AITO: AI-Powered Intelligent Traffic Optimization System

> **Note:** This project is **under active development**. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

---

## 📌 Overview

**AITO** (AI-powered Intelligent Traffic Optimization) is a full-stack, modular traffic control and optimization platform. It dynamically manages vehicle routing in real time using AI/ML and rich public infrastructure data — including **weather**, **school timings**, **road width**, **vehicle size**, **event schedules**, **Google Maps traffic data**, and more — to optimize mobility in cities.

The system predicts congestion before it happens and proactively reroutes traffic. Whether it's **public transport (e.g. TSRTC buses)** or **general road traffic**, AITO helps intelligently split traffic using **all viable roads** based on AI's understanding of the city.

---

## 🧠 Core Features

* ✅ AI-powered route decision-making (SmartRoute Engine)
* ✅ Predicts congestion and reroutes *before* it happens
* ✅ Considers **vehicle size**, **road width**, **crowd flow**, **time**, **events**, **weather**
* ✅ Real-time and historical data analysis
* ✅ React + FastAPI full-stack architecture
* ✅ Multi-user form interface and smart API
* ✅ Smart rerouting within allowed road constraints
* ✅ Future integration with Google Maps API for real-time traffic overlays
* ✅ TSRTC-aware suggestions based on fixed routes

---

## 🌟 Project Goals

**To revolutionize urban mobility** by reducing traffic congestion, optimizing public and private transport routes, and enabling cities to **react before traffic happens**—not after.

1. **Optimize TSRTC & public transport**: Smartly balance passengers using fixed routes
2. **Prevent congestion** using predictive modeling and AI routing
3. **Minimize fuel use**, delays, and emissions across traffic segments
4. **Use all valid paths** (including service roads or alternate legal routes)
5. **Personalize suggestions** using context-aware AI (user type, time, traffic, etc.)
6. **Build real-time, dynamic, map-enhanced interfaces** for all users (public and admin)

---

## 🚀 Use Cases

* 🚌 Suggesting best routes to passengers based on live traffic
* 🚦 Preventing choke points by proactively redistributing traffic
* ☁️ Adapting based on weather or local events
* 🎓 Considering school/college timings to reroute efficiently
* 🚗 Vehicle-size-aware routing suggestions
* 🛣️ Smart route splits for fixed-route systems (TSRTC buses)
* 🌎 Multi-path usage when possible (service lanes, alternates)
* 📊 Public + Admin dashboards (future)

---

## 📈 Future Vision

* 🔌 Plug into **GHMC / Hyderabad live traffic APIs**
* ⛅ Real-time weather + event + road closure detection
* 🚌 Bus-specific routing with stop-by-stop congestion awareness
* 💡 Smart signage: Recommend real-time digital board routing
* 📱 Mobile app for user-side route suggestions
* 🧠 Learn from daily patterns (morning vs evening rush, etc.)
* 📊 Admin dashboard with full heatmaps + user behavior

---

## 🧠 Key Features

* 🔁 **Smart Route Prediction** — AI-based selection of optimal route based on vehicle size, road width, weather, traffic density, and more.
* 🌧️ **Environment-aware Decisioning** — Rain, cloud cover, and time-of-day influence path selection.
* 🏫 **School & Emergency Zones** — Adjust timings and restrictions dynamically.
* 🗺️ **Multi-path Routing** — Suggests alternate routes, even through sub-streets or feeder roads.
* 🛑 **Incident Logging & Rerouting** — Handles accidents, blockages, or emergency needs.
* 📊 **Traffic Pattern Analysis** — Backend ML models continuously learn from historical & real-time data.
* 🔄 **FastAPI REST Interface** — Robust API for integration with apps, buses, or city infrastructure.

---

## 🧩 Use Cases

* **Public Bus Routing** on constrained city roads (fixed bus stops).
* **Emergency Vehicle Clearance** via shortest safe dynamic paths.
* **School Time Restrictions** applied automatically in AI engine.
* **Congestion Dissolution**: AI splits vehicles into parallel paths to de-clog a hotspot.
* **Weather-aware Routing**: Suggests paths that drain well during rain.
* **Micro-route Management**: Suggests alternate street-level paths based on road width and vehicle size.

## 🗺️ Google Maps API Integration

We planning to use the following features:

### ✅ **Google Maps Platform APIs**

| API                     | Use                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Directions API**      | Compute alternate routes         |
| **Distance Matrix API** | Get traffic-based ETA            |
| **Maps JavaScript API** | Visual overlays on live map      |
| **Geocoding API**       | Convert addresses to lat/lng     |
| **Roads API**           | Snap to road segments            |
| **Traffic Layer**       | (future) Live congestion visuals |

---

## 🧠 AI Algorithms (Simplified for Phase 1)

* **Weighted Route Scoring** based on inputs:

  ```python
  score = α1*traffic_density + α2*weather_penalty + α3*school_zone_delay
  ```
* **Heuristic Filtering** to discard unfit routes.
* **Randomized Softmax** to avoid overusing same path:

  ```python
  probability_i = e^(score_i) / Σ e^(score_j)
  ```
* **Predictive Congestion Modeling (Planned)**:
  Using LSTM for short-term congestion forecasting.

---

## 🧾 `SmartRouteForm.jsx` Component Overview

This is the **frontend UI form** where users submit route details like source, destination, time, and user type (student, office-goer, etc). The form sends a POST request to the FastAPI backend.

### 🔧 Form Fields:

* `Source`: Input/select box for origin point (e.g., "Ameerpet")
* `Destination`: Input/select box for destination (e.g., "Gachibowli")
* `Time`: Input (or datetime picker) for travel time
* `User Type`: Dropdown with options like "student", "office", "public"

### 📤 API Interaction:

When the form is submitted:

* It sends a POST request to: `http://localhost:8000/api/smart-route`
* Payload is JSON with the form fields
* Displays response (`recommended_route`, `eta`, `reasoning`) in a result card

### ✅ Sample Code Logic:

```jsx
const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();

  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/smart-route', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ source, destination, time, user_type }),
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  setResult(data);
};
```

Make sure CORS is enabled in FastAPI (done using `fastapi.middleware.cors`).

---

## 🧠 SmartRoute Algorithm Design (Initial Backend Logic)

The backend route handler in `main.py` (under `/api/smart-route`) uses a **rule-based mock AI** approach for now.

### 🚀 Current Version (Simplified Logic)

```python
@app.post("/api/smart-route")
def smart_route(req: SmartRouteRequest):
    # Rule engine based on time and user type
    if req.user_type == "student" and req.time.startswith("08"):
        return {
            "recommended_route": "Route-1",
            "eta": "22 minutes",
            "reasoning": "Avoids congested school zones during rush"
        }
    else:
        return {
            "recommended_route": "Route-3",
            "eta": "28 minutes",
            "reasoning": "Reroutes via wider, less congested corridor"
        }
```

This is a placeholder until the real ML + graph search engine is ready.

## 🧠 SmartRoute Engine: Advanced ML + Routing Stack

**Key Capabilities:**

* Graph-based routing with context-aware constraints
* Personalized recommendations using user type + real-time events
* Predictive modeling with time-windowed traffic patterns

**Pipeline Overview:**

```
User Request
    ↓
Route Graph Builder → Weight Assigner → Constraint Checker
    ↓                        ↓                     ↓
Real-time Data     Historical Traffic DB    Road Width + Time Rules
    ↓                        ↓                     ↓
    └─────────→ ML Load Predictor → Final Route Selector
                                 ↓
                      Returns top 1–3 optimal routes
```

### Algorithms Gonna be Used:

* **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: For base shortest-path routing
* **Constraint BFS**: BFS traversal with custom filters
* **ML Model** (planned): Regression model to predict traffic load
* **Heuristic Engine**: Boosts routes that avoid:

  * Narrow roads during peak time
  * School zones in morning hours
  * Rain-sensitive roads when weather API = rain

India's urban road networks often collapse under **predictable yet unmanaged traffic surges**. AITO flips the script by letting AI:

* Think like a commuter
* Predict like a weather model
* Adapt like a traffic officer
* React faster than humans can
